This folder includes data to estimate community resilience index at the county level and a federal government index of the risk of  
extreme climate change events at the county and census track level. Data are from the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency 
Management Administration Nation Risk Index https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/ and their open data portal Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level 
Data http://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/. The Census/ACS demographic data used to construct a population resilience index
is downloaded directly from the Census API into R using the tidycensus package.
