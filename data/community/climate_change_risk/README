The National Risk Index is a dataset and online tool to help illustrate the U.S. communities most at
risk for 18 natural hazards. It was designed and built by FEMA in close collaboration with various
stakeholders and partners in academia; local, state and federal government; and private industry.
The Risk Index leverages available source data for natural hazard and community risk factors to
develop a baseline relative risk measurement for each U.S. county and Census tract. The National
Risk Index is intended to help users better understand the natural hazard risk of their communities.
Intended users include planners and emergency managers at the local, regional, state, and federal
levels, as well as other decision makers and interested members of the general public
