This folder contains data from Brown University's School of Public Health. LTCfocus.org provides data on nursing home 
care in the US. Our goal is to allow researchers to trace relationships between state policies, local market forces, 
and the quality of long-term care and enable policymakers to craft state and local guidelines that promote high-quality, 
cost-effective, equitable care for older Americans. These LTCFocus data are from the CASPER (Certification and Survey Provider 
Enhanced Reporting) system. This sustem is generated from the Minimum Daily Set that is submitted quarterly by long term care
facilities that are recipiencts of Medicare or Medicaid. The CASPER system is not publically available but are aggregated 
by Brown University's School of Public Health and made available at the the SNK, county, and state level.
