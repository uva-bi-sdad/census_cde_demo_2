This folder contains two .csv files with the variables derived vrom synthetic information.


1. snf_to_synthetic_information_mapping
The file snf_to_synthetic_information_mapping includes mapping between cms' skilled nursing facilities to activity locations in NSSAC 
synthetic population ver. 2.0 for Virginia, US.

## Header

- **federal\_provider\_number** unique id for skilled nursing facility
- **si\_loc\_id** unique id for activity location
- **distance** distance between skilled nursing facility's geo location and activity location (in meter)
- **rfld\_risks** river flooding risk score
- **rfld\_riskr** river flooding risk rank
- **cfld\_risks** coastal flooding risk score
- **cfld\_riskr** coastal flooding risk rank

## Notes

1. Flooding risks were assigned based on skilled nursing facility's location using 2022 FEMA national risk index.
   (see ../community/climate\_change\_risk)
2. The TIGER/Line tract polygons for 2022 FEMA national risks is 2017.
3. More information on mapping can be found in ../../documents/products/processes/commute\_vulnerability/algorithm.md


2. snf_to_worker_flood_risk
The file is nf_to_worker_flood_risk includes flood risks estimate for each worker's route to work.

## Header

- **pid** worker's unique id in NSSAC synthetic population ver. 2.0 for Virginia, US
- **federal\_provider\_number** unique id for skilled nursing facility
- **snf\_tract\_rfld\_risks** underlying tract's river flooding risk score
- **snf\_tract\_cfld\_risks** underlying tract's coastal flooding risk score
- **route\_max\_rfld\_risks** maximum river flooding risk score on worker's route
- **route\_max\_cfld\_risks** maximum coastal flooding risk score on worker's route
- **route\_max\_combined\_risks** sum of route\_max\_rfld\_risks and route\_max\_cfld\_risks
