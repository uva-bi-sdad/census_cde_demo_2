# Commute Vulnerability

## Synopsis

This document gives a description of the the following components related to assessment of nursing home vulnerability as a function of workers
being unable to report to work due to modeled impact on transportation
infrastructure.

## Data

The following data sets were used:
  - The NSSAC synthetic population ver. 2.0 for Virginia, US (DP-US-VA-2.0);
  - The NSSAC Building Database for the US (BDB-1.0);
  - HERE Premium Streets road data (2021/Q1);
  - FEMA riverine and coastal flooding maps;

##Computational modules

The following modules were used:
  - **A** The NSSAC road infrastructure extraction tool for HERE data;
  - **B** The NSSAC network conversion tool for mapping the extracted HERE data into a form suited for routing.
  - **C** Conversion tool for mapping the routing data into a format usable for the Qwest (?) routing suite (by NSSAC GRA Ashik Islam)
  - **D** The Qwest (?) routing tool (Ashik Islam)
  - **E** Custom extraction scripts for extraction of nursing home in the DP-US-VA-2.0 and BDB-1.0, and aligning these with SDAD's data;
  - **F** A custom extraction script to determine the DP-US-VA-2.0 sub-population (with households) that work at the nursing homes, and their residence locations;
  - **G** A custom script to determine the risk associated with a person's route on the transportation network;
  - **H** A custom script to assess nursing home vulnerability based on its workers commute paths and modeled vulnerability of these;

## Algorithm

The sequence of steps in the algorithm to determine nursing home vulnerability on the transportation dimension are as follows:

1. Run the modules **A**, **B** and **C** in sequence to generate the routing network G(routing).
2. Run the tools in module **E** to determine the subset L(nursing homes) of locations in VA that are nursing homes;
3. Run module **G** to determine the set of people P(workers) in DP-US-VA-2.0 whose workplace are in L(nursing homes) and their residence locations L(workers);
4. For each worker p in P(workers), use module **D** to generate the pair Routes(p) of detailed routes from their residence to their work location and back;
5. For each worker p in P(workers), run module **G** to integrate the pair of routes in Routes(p) against the FEMA risk map data to give each route a vulnerability index;
6. For each nursing home, use module **H** to determine its vulnerability with respect to transportation impacts as the fraction of workers deemed unable to report to work.


## Alternatives to approaches above

*FEMA data:* in a more elaborate study, FEMA data would be replaced, possibly by flooding related maps from NOAA.

*Household structure:* considerations based on household composition (e.g., single parent) could factor into the reporting-to-work assessment. Household income could also factor into the decision making.

*Route construction:* routing over a network while incorporating damage from flooding would offer route alternatives that could factor into the assessment. In addition, network loading could be applied to assess traffic congestion as a result transportation infrastructure damages. Public transportation could also be considered.

*Nursing home worker population:* an alternative to directly using
DP-US-VA-2.0 would be to for each nursing home h combine (a) worker
count for h from nursing home with (b) LODES/ACS commute data to
determine the distribution of worker's home counties (or census
tracts) for h. Sampling from this distribution for h, one could either
(1) sample the appropriate number of residence locations within the
respective home administrative regions, or (2) identify workers within
DP-US-VA-2.0 with NAICS designation corresponding to care
facilitation. Both approaches (1 and 2) would allow one to accurately
match worker counts.
